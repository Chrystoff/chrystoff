### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### My Name is Brian!

I am from Tasmania! Which is an Island State of Australia. I'm just a regular human trying to get into coding!

I'm a recent Graduate from Coder Academy's - Accelerated Web Development Course. I'm currently looking for work in the industry! for now I'll just be taking on projects from Friends and Family to build a portfolio.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about TTRPGs/Distilling/Brewing/40k/Golf/Wine/Cocktails, these were all hobbies I dip in and out of!
